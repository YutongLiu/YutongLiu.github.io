**Cleaning and maintaining a claypot**

(1)	Clean the claypot when it is cool with water and dry at room temperature, detergent and soap is not recommended
(2)	Oil the claypot after each cleaning when it’s still new
(3)	Dirt remains easily due to the pores on the surface of claypot, but claypot gets better as it gets older
