**Ingredients** (1 portion）



White rice[1]  135ml （≈120g）  


Water 135ml  


（optional）vegetable oil 10ml




**Equipment**



Cantonese claypot (⌀16.5cm size 550ml)


Stove top（1.8kw）




**Advance Prep**



(1)	Seasoning a brand new claypot（2~3days）


a)	Clean the pot with water，submerge it at room temperature for 24h


b)	Dry at room temperature for 12~24h


c)	Oil[2] the pot by rubbing every surface and let the oil soak in totally



(2)	35 minutes before cooking


a)	Rinse and soak：rinse the rice 3~4 times until water is clear to wash away excess starches on the surface，strain and soak for about 30 minutes at room temperature


b)	Submerge the claypot in warm water, dry and rub a thin layer of oil over the bottom interior before using（optional）




**Cooking**（30~35 minutes）



(1)	After preheat the claypot, bring to a boil over high heat, about 5~10 minutes


(2)	Simmer over medium-high heat for 3~5 minutes (a spoon might be useful to prevent slight spills)


(3)	Steam over very low heat for 15~17 minutes, rotate the claypot by a quarter-turn every minute to ensure an even heat distribution


(4)	Spoon oil and pour around the edge of the lid but with the lid still on (optional)


(5)	Let it stand with the lid still on for 5~10 minutes




**Cleaning and maintaining a claypot**



(1)	Clean the claypot when it is cool with water and dry at room temperature, detergent and soap is not recommended


(2)	Oil the claypot after each cleaning when it’s still new


(3)	Dirt remains easily due to the pores on the surface of claypot, but claypot gets better as it gets older
